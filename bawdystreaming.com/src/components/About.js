      <h3>About Bawdy Streaming</h3>
      <p>Bawdy Streaming is a dedicated site for all streaming content for Bawdy Storytelling which is entering Year TEN! 
      Bawdy Storytelling is the Nation's Original Sex+Storytelling series. True stories of Sex Kink &amp; Gender told live onstage!
      Featuring storytellers like the person sitting next to you on the train, to porn stars, to icons in the sex-positive community.</p>
      <p>Bawdy Streaming features live web streams of Bawdy Storytelling's monthly San Francisco shows on the <NavLink to='/live'>Live</NavLink> Page which begins right before the show starts.</p>
      <p>As well as live broadcasts, streams of previous shows are available at your leisure on demand in the <NavLink to='/vod'>VOD (Video On Demand)</NavLink> Page.</p>
      <p>Bawdy Streaming rose out of Bawdy Storytelling's rising popularity which has expanded to Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago and now Portland. The idea began to expand the audience and to be able to broadcast San Francisco's show to Bawdy fans in other cities as well as fans who prefer the comfort of their own home. Conceived and developed by Rubeun of <a href="http://web.rubeun.com/">Rubeun Tan Web Services</a>, Bawdy Streaming was launched in 2016.</p>
